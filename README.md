# slow-down

Personal-use skill.

This skill helps an agent slow down, stay more felt and present, and avoid outrunning human connection. Use it when you want pace-keeping, minimal questioning, and gentle intervention only when speed risks numbness or relational harm.

Find the skill:

```bash
npx skills find slow-down
```

Add the skill:
1. Copy `skills/slow-down` into your agent's `skills/` directory.
2. Or use the Vercel Labs Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add leovoon/slow-down@slow-down
```
